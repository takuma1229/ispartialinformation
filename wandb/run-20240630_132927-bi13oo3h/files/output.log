The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is not the same type as the class this function is called from. It may result in unexpected tokenization.
The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is 'BertJapaneseTokenizer'.
The class this function is called from is 'BertTokenizer'.
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at tohoku-nlp/bert-base-japanese-v3 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
