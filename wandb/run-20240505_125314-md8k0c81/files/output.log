Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
